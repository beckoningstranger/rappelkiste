# Rappelkiste e.V.

Rappelkiste e.V. is a site that is aimed at parents who are looking for a day care center for their unborn or newly born child. The German word Rappelkiste could be translated loosely to 'rattlebox', it refers to the house (the box) from which you can hear all kinds of noises (the rattling). "e.V." means "registered association", which is legally relevant and also hints at the fact that this day care center is special in that it was founded and is still run by parents, not the state, a church or any other institution.

Visitors of the site are supposed to get a first impression of what makes this day care center special, i.e. is the picturesque building, the interior's cozy atmosphere, the friendly teachers, the fact that it has an above average sized team and that the teachers have lots of interesting activities and projects in store for the children which parents can read about in the Stories section. Users can then use the Get in Touch page or click the telephone/email links to contact the day care center.

Take a look at the deployed page: <a href="https://beckoningstranger.github.io/rappelkiste/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rappelkiste</a>.

## Design

### Color Scheme

![Color Scheme](/assets/README-images/color-scheme.png)

The color True Blue (#3567BB) was taken from the hero image that you see when you first visit the site, the darker blues were picked to create nice looking gradients that ensured contrast to keep the overlaid white text easy to read. 
On the Team page, where the larger font size makes the text easier to read, I have picked a True Blue (#3567BB) to Dark Cornflower Blue (#19366D) gradient, on the Stories page, where the font size is significantly smaller and there's also just more text I have picked a Dark Cornflower Blue (#19366D) to Oxford Blue (#0A214B) gradient.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

- Lusitana is used for headings and body text of the site. It is a serif font that is still very easy to read.

- Meow Script is a monoline font that adds character to the site's logo.
