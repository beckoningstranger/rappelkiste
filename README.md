# Rappelkiste e.V.

Rappelkiste e.V. is a site that is aimed at parents who are looking for a day care center for their unborn or newly born child. The German word Rappelkiste could be translated loosely to 'rattlebox', it refers to the house (the box) from which you can hear all kinds of noises (the rattling). "e.V." means "registered association", which is legally relevant and also hints at the fact that this day care center is special in that it was founded and is still run by parents, not the state, a church or any other institution.

Visitors of the site are supposed to get a first impression of what makes this day care center special, i.e. is the picturesque building, the interior's cozy atmosphere, the friendly teachers, the fact that it has an above average sized team and that the teachers have lots of interesting activities and projects in store for the children which parents can read about in the Stories section. Users can then use the Get in Touch page or click the telephone/email links to contact the day care center.

## Design

### Site Structure

The website consists of four main pages and a thank you page. The [Home page](index.html) is the landing page, while the [Team page](team.html), the [Stories](stories.html) and the [Get in Touch](contact.html) page are accessible via the top menu. Once the user successfully submits a message on the [Get in Touch page](contact.html), they are taken to a simple [Thank You page](thankyou.html), from where they can navigate anywhere they want via the top menu.

### Color Scheme

![Color Scheme](/assets/README-images/color-scheme.jpg)

The color True Blue (#3567BB) was taken from the hero image that you see when you first visit the site, the darker blues were picked to create nice looking gradients that ensured contrast to keep the overlaid white text easy to read. The True Blue that's also present on every site in the header will hopefully set the mood for the entire page, as it is associated with good weather, sunshine and all the feelings that are associated with that.
On the Team page, where the larger font size makes the text easier to read, I have picked a True Blue (#3567BB) to Dark Cornflower Blue (#19366D) gradient, on the Stories page, where the font size is significantly smaller and there's also just more text I have picked a Dark Cornflower Blue (#19366D) to Oxford Blue (#0A214B) gradient.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

- Lusitana is used for headings and body text of the site. It is a serif font that is still very easy to read.

- Meow Script is a monoline font that adds character to the site's logo.

### Wireframes

At the outset of this project, the design of the website was desktop first, which is why the emphasis was on creating wireframes for this size format. This later changed, but all designs found their way into the final website except for the Contat page which was redesigned at a late stage of development.

![Home Wireframe](/assets/README-images/home-wireframe.jpg)
![Team Wireframe](/assets/README-images/team-wireframe.jpg)
![Stories Wireframe](/assets/README-images/stories-wireframe.jpg)
![Get in Touch Wireframe](/assets/README-images/get-in-touch-wireframe.jpg)

As this was my first foray into designing, I had to adapt when I found that the initial design would not work. The most significant of these changes was the contact page where I found that the two-column design with the clearly defined border in the middle would not be practical, even on larger screens as the picture would be cut off. I eventually opted for a screen filling background picture with an overlaid box for the text and form.

The initial Team page design was realized for mid-sized screens, i.e. larger phones in landscape mode and tablets. For smaller viewports I decided on a one-column design and for viewports over 1200px in width I found a completely new design that presents the team as a whole in one line with a text box under the pictures with changing text, depending on which picture the user taps/hovers. Even though I like this design, it's probably the poorest UX of all the ones present here, because users will find the page with an empty text box before they tap/hover a picture. I intend to change this once I learn about JavaScript, so that the user will find the page with a photo preselected and the text box at the bottom filled. Unfortunately there does not seem to be a way to do this with pure HTML/CSS, I did quite some research and also eventually consulted the tutor team.
