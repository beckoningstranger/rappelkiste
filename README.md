# Rappelkiste e.V.

Rappelkiste e.V. is a site that is aimed at parents who are looking for a day care center for their unborn or newly born child. The German word Rappelkiste could be translated loosely to 'rattlebox', it refers to the house (the box) from which you can hear all kinds of noises (the rattling). "e.V." means "registered association", which is legally relevant and also hints at the fact that this day care center is special in that it was founded and is still run by parents, not the state, a church or any other institution.
