                                <p class="blog-date">published July 7th, 2022</p>

                            <p>When my colleague Britta came up with the idea of ​​doing a first aid project with our children, I was more than skeptical. Anyone who has ever taken a first aid course knows that these topics are not made for children.</p>
                            <p>So we reviewed the material and starting planning.<br>First aid, what is that?</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Rescue Chain</li>
                                <li>Escape routes</li>
                                <li>Associations</li>
                                <li>Burns</li>
                                <li>Hypothermia</li>
                                <li>Poisoning</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>We discussed these topics with our children aged 4 and up.
                            Every day after breakfast or after resting, we sat down with our children and worked out all the topics in a way that was child-friendly.
                            Picture stories, role play and lots of practical exercises made our work easier.
                            The children picked up the phone themselves, “dialed” the emergency number and spoke to an imaginary person at the other end of the line.
                            We walked through our house together and discovered fire extinguishers and "escape route signs".
                            We bandaged each other. In the kitchen we discovered that not all bottles and kitchen utensils are good for us or even taste good.</p>
                            <p>In summary, I can say that working on first aid with children is very doable and a lot of fun. <br>
                            Übrigens, fällt der Satz „Kann ich helfen?“ jetzt viel öfter bei unseren Kindern, denn schon das macht uns zu einem Ersthelfer und das wollen unsere Kinder jetzt ganz sicher sein.</p>

                                <p class="blog-author">by Britta Steinebach,</p>
                                <p class="blog-date">published March 1st, 2022</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="blog-body"><p>Every year the nice policeman comes by with his patrol car and we spend a fun and very instructive morning together.
                            Before we really get started with the road rules and the behavior that we should follow to be safe, Mr. Röcher takes out a roll of crepe paper and looks around questioningly.
                            Of course, the first thing he wants to know is the children's names so he doesn't always have to say "you there".<br>
                            He also explains to us that it is super important to know your name and also where you live so that you can either find your way home if you get lost or get help if you need it at home.</p>
                            <p>You proudly say your name and get a name tag glued on. After that it really starts.</p>
                            <p>What is a street made of? Where do the cars go and where do the pedestrians walk? A schoolboy objected that hot air balloons shouldn't land on the sidewalks.
                            Good idea, they would be completely in the way. Of course, the cars drive on the road and may only be parked in parking spaces designated for them. There are also extra signs that allow parking on the sidewalk.
                            We also take a close look at the stop stone. That's what we call the stone between the road and the footpath. We stop there and look twice in each direction to see if a car is coming.
                            If nothing comes, then we go straight and briskly across the street. So we take the shortest route.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Röcher's little helper, the tiger Theo, has not learned his lesson. He doesn't look properly, he just starts running, in wavy lines and even sits down in the middle of the street... Good thing we're just practicing and the street he's walking across is just a carpet in the shape of a street.</p>
                            <p>After Theo has finally managed to cross the street in an exemplary manner, we go outside and practice what we have learned directly on our street in front of the Rappelkiste.
                            You have a lot of fun and are happy that Mr. Röcher praises you.</p>
                            <p>So we say goodbye to the policeman and watch his blue and silver patrol car go by.</p></div>

                            <p>The world is full of wonders and because our children discover the world in their own way, we want to try to explain these wonders to them in child-friendly ways.</p>
                            <p>At our last parents' meeting, the parents had the opportunity to take part in our educational offers. We presented the areas of our work, exchanged ideas and together we collected wishes and suggestions that complement our work. For this reason, weekly experiments are currently taking place for and with the children. This is how we get on the trail of the tricks of nature and technology together.</p>
                            <p>Here are some of our working titles:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>"The ghost hand that almost moves by itself"</li>
                                <li>"A homemade microscope"</li>
                                <li>"What happens to corn when you heat it?"</li>
