                                <p class="blog-date">on March 1st, 2022</p>

                        <div class="blog-body"><p>Every year the nice policeman comes by with his patrol car and we spend a fun and very instructive morning together.
                            Before we really get started with the road rules and the behavior that we should follow to be safe, Mr. Röcher takes out a roll of crepe paper and looks around questioningly.
                            Of course, the first thing he wants to know is the children's names so he doesn't always have to say "you there".<br>
                            He also explains to us that it is super important to know your name and also where you live so that you can either find your way home if you get lost or get help if you need it at home.</p>
                            <p>You proudly say your name and get a name tag glued on. After that it really starts.</p>
                            <p>What is a street made of? Where do the cars go and where do the pedestrians walk? A schoolboy objected that hot air balloons shouldn't land on the sidewalks.
                            Good idea, they would be completely in the way. Of course, the cars drive on the road and may only be parked in parking spaces designated for them. There are also extra signs that allow parking on the sidewalk.
                            We also take a close look at the stop stone. That's what we call the stone between the road and the footpath. We stop there and look twice in each direction to see if a car is coming.
                            If nothing comes, then we go straight and briskly across the street. So we take the shortest route.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Röcher's little helper, the tiger Theo, has not learned his lesson. He doesn't look properly, he just starts running, in wavy lines and even sits down in the middle of the street... Good thing we're just practicing and the street he's walking across is just a carpet in the shape of a street.</p>
                            <p>After Theo has finally managed to cross the street in an exemplary manner, we go outside and practice what we have learned directly on our street in front of the Rappelkiste.
                            You have a lot of fun and are happy that Mr. Röcher praises you.</p>
                            <p>So we say goodbye to the policeman and watch his blue and silver patrol car go by.</p></div>
